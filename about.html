                Menswear designer Todd Snyder offers timeless essentials, statement pieces, custom suiting, and iconic accessories, all of which embody the best of modern American style.
                Since launching his eponymous label in 2011, Todd has built his love of New York City into the DNA of the Todd Snyder brand. From bespoke tailoring to innovative capsule collections, Todd Snyder’s menswear ensures that good style is always within reach. Shop exclusive, limited-edition collaborations with heritage brands like Champion, New Balance, Timex, Moscot, FootJoy and more. And don’t forget to visit us in person at one of our stores, the go-to shopping destinations for fashion insiders, menswear enthusiasts and sharp dressers worldwide.
                From day one, Todd has always been focused on the quintessential pieces of a good wardrobe. With Todd Snyder Classics, we present the best possible versions of those core menswear styles. Sometimes that means taking a hardworking essential and reimagining it in luxurious materials. Other times, it involves refreshing a vintage menswear style with a modern fit and details.
                <br><br>
                Case in point: our iconic Dylan Jackets, available in a range of fabrics, from suede and burnished leather to denim and waxed canvas. There are also our military-inspired Gurkha Pants, signature Sweater Polos and more — all of the building blocks you need to look your best. We call these menswear styles “Classics” because while fashions may change, classics will always stand the test of time.
                Todd Snyder also offers a robust lineup of year-round menswear staples. These are quality clothes that are designed to look smart and last a lifetime of wear, season after season. Head to our Suit Shop for refined, easy-to-wear sport coats, suit jackets, trousers and other men's suiting favorites. Check out our Made to Measure offering, where one of our expert tailors will work with you to create garments with the perfect fit and look for your unique style.
                <br><br>
                From our classic Favorite Oxford Shirts and heritage Made in USA Denim, to the comfy sweatpants, joggers and hoodies in our Champion Foundation Collection, there’s something for everyone, every occasion, and every time of year.
                For now, make sure you’re prepared for spring and summer by finding the perfect easy layers in our Coat Shop, whether you’re looking for chore coats, shirt jackets, denim jackets, trail jackets, raincoats, CPO jackets or more. Minimal or packed with practical details, refined or rugged (or both), there’s a diverse range of menswear options. And don’t miss the chance to explore our Warm-Weather Shop, a curated selection of vacation-ready go-to's that Todd has refreshed with elevated fabrics and sophisticated design details (think Irish linen shirts and indigo-dyed tees). Plus, look (and feel) cool all season long with our easy Camp Collar Shirts in bold patterns, Randolph sunglasses, cotton-linen polos, suede sandals, recycled nylon swim shorts and more.
